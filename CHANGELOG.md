## [Unreleased]

The plan, and the move to the portfolio template. No functional code yet.

### Added

- `dev/PLAN.md`: the door (admission by address, prefix, fingerprint, session,
  and account), in-flight revocation through epoch-gated checkpoints,
  wipe-replace-eject, ban memory with prefix escalation, strikes, threats by
  attacker tier, what it does not cover, architecture, performance targets,
  ecosystem, open decisions, and the decision log.
- `dev/DIRECTIVES.md` and `dev/ROADMAP.md`.
- `deny.toml`, `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `docs/release/v0.1.0.md`.
- Session revocations from gate-net, and tombstone, decoy, and binding
  signals as strikes (`dev/PLAN.md` section 4).

### Changed

- Edition 2024, MSRV 1.85, and `Apache-2.0 OR MIT` (was edition 2021, MSRV
  1.75, Apache-2.0 only).
- CI runs Linux, macOS, and Windows on stable and 1.85, plus `cargo audit`
  and `cargo deny`.
- The crate description now states the purpose: a connection gate with
  in-flight revocation, not a rate limiter.
- Planning documents moved from the private `.dev/` to the committed `dev/`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Initial repository scaffold: README, REPS specification stub, CI workflow,
  `.dev/` planning structure.
